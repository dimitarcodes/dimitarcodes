## Hi there 👋

My name is Dimitar and I love tech + neuroscience 🧠❤️🤖

## My academic background

I completed both my BSc and MSc in AI for Neurotechnology at Radboud University Nijmegen. 

What's ✨special✨ about my degrees is that beyond the standard computer science + machine learning, I also gained a lot of knowledge in neuroscience and cognitive psychology.

## My professional interests

Recently I've been interning as a DevOps engineer at a major telecom, and I'd love to keep working as a DevOps engineer or a Data Engineer.
Currently do not have anything aligned past Feb 2026, so if my profile sparks any interest - please do reach out :)

## My skills

I have a varied experience with exposure to:
- tons of programming languages (Python, Java, C#, C, C++, JavaScript, Kotlin, Scala, Go, Clean), but I mainly code in Python
- machine learning + agentic AI libraries - scikit-learn, scipy, pytorch, tensorflow, xgboost, mne, pymc, gym, langchain, langgraph
- data processing tools - pandas, polars, duckdb, Spark
- databases management systems - SQL (PostgreSQL, SQLite) + NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis)
- devops/gitops tools - git, Docker, Kubernetes, GitLab CI/CD, Helm, argoCD, Crossplane
- obsevability tools - Grafana, Langfuse
- frontend tools - Next.JS, React, Freemarker
- backend tools - FastAPI, uvicorn, Ktor
- orchestration tools - cron, Airflow

I love technology and learning new tools.

Whenever I encounter something I haven't worked with before my instinct is to dive headfirst.

I am definitely not an expert in all the tools I listed, but that's natural in my opinion.

Currently aiming to complement the wide breadth of tools with more depth in one specific area.
